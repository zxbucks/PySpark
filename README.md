A collection of useful scripts I use as Fabric Data Engineer.

🛠️ PySpark scripts include dataframe automation, REST API integration, and Lakehouse medallion architecture.

🚀 How to Use Feel free to clone the repository or copy individual scripts. Review each script before execution—some require sysadmin or elevated permissions. Test in a non-production environment first. Modify as needed, but keep attribution (see License).
